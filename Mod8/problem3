# 3. Create a text file called song_lyrics.txt and copy the lyrics of a song into
# it. Write a Python program that:
# - Reads the file
# - Requests 5 inputs from the user: 5 words the user would like to count the frequency of
# - Counts how many times each word appears
# - Creates a dictionary of the words and their counts
# - Print the dictionary to the console
