# 2. Write a Python program that allows users to log their hiking trips. The program should:
# - Use a while loop to repeatedly ask for a hike name and distance in miles
# - Save each entry to hiking_log.txt (each hike on a new line)
# - When the user presses 0, exit the loop & print the contents of hiking_log.txt

file = open('hiking_log.txt', 'w')
file.write("My Hikes:\n")
file.close()

file = open('hiking_log.txt', 'a')
while True:
    h_name = str(input("What was the name of this hike? (0 to exit): "))
    if h_name == str(0):
        break
    h_length = float(input("How long was it?: "))
    with open('hiking_log.txt', 'a') as file:
        file.write(f"- {h_name}, {h_length} miles\n")
        file.close()
    with open('hiking_log.txt', 'r') as file:
        print(file.read())
        file.close()
