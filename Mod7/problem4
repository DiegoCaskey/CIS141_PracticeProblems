# 4. Write a function called ferry_fare(age, vehicle) that calculates the Washington
# State Ferry fare based on age and whether the person has a vehicle. Assume the following rates:
# * Adults (19-64): $10 without a vehicle, $20 with a vehicle.
# * Seniors (65+): $5 without a vehicle, $15 with a vehicle.
# * Children (0-18): Free.
