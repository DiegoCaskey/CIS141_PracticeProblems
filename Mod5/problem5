#5. Write a program that continuously asks the user to input a number. If the user enters 0, immediately stop asking for more numbers. Otherwise, print the number they entered. Sample interaction:
# Enter a number (0 to stop): 4
# You entered 4
# Enter a number (0 to stop): 7
# You entered 7
# Enter a number (0 to stop): 0
# Exiting...
num = int(input("Give me any whole number besides 0...I don't like those: "))
while num != 0:
    num = int(input("Om-nom-nom. Give me another number!: "))
    if num == 0:
        print("Destroying world in:\n3...\n2...\n1...")
