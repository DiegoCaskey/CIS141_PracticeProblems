#4.  Create a list of integers. Write code that counts how many numbers are positive and how many are negative, then print both counts.
numbers = [-3,-2,-1,10,20,30,40]
count_pos = 0
count_neg = 0
for number in numbers:
    if number > 0:
        count_pos += 1
    elif number < 0:
        count_neg += 1
print(f"Positive Count: {count_pos}\nNegative Count: {count_neg}")
