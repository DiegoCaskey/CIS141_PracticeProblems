#1. Create a list of integers (you get to pick!). Write code to iterate through the list and calculate the sum of all even numbers. Print the resulting sum.
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
new_list = []
for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        new_list.append(number)
print(new_list) #Added print for understanding
print(sum(new_list))
