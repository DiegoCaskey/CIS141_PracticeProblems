#5. A store charges $5 for shipping on any order under $50. If the order amount is $50 or more, shipping is free. Ask the user for the order total and print the total cost, including shipping.
price = float(input("How much was your order?: "))
if price >= 50:
     print(f"This order qualifies for free shipping. The total will be ${price}")
else:
    new_price = price + 5
    print(f"This order does not qualify for free shipping. The total will be ${new_price}")
