#2. The headlights of a car should only automatically turn on when the daylight outside is below a certain threshold. If a sensor threshold is below the number 8, print "Headlights On"; otherwise, print "Headlights Off".
reading = float(input("The sensor is inoperable. Please enter the sensor reading manually: "))
threshold = 8
if reading >= threshold:
    print("*The headlights turn on*")
else:
    print("*The turn headlights off*")
